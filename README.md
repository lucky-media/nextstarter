This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Fonts

This project uses @fontsource to install Google Fonts as NPM packages in order to avoid penalties in Google Lighthouse.
To browse the fonts you can [go here](https://fontsource.github.io/search-directory/), or you can checkout the [@fontsource](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource) on Github.

After you have installed your preffered font you can import it to `_app.js`:

```js
import '@fontsource/poppins/500.css'
import '@fontsource/poppins/700.css'
```
